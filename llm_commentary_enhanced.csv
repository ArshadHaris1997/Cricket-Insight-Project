Full, angling in towards leg stump, following Siraj's attempt to create room. Drives and almost yorks Babar at mid-off.

Did the bat hit the ground? Ultra Edge suggests it's inside edge, and there's daylight between the toe of the bat and the ground. Well, then, Pakistan are seven down!",,Neutral,High

1415721,4.2,Tanzim Hasan Sakib,0,1,Tristan Stubbs,"spooned to short cover! Looked like the ball stopped on to Stubbs. Well taken by Shakib diving forward, as he went low while the ball died on to him. A short-of-a-length ball from Sakib in the channel outside off, as Stubbs went pushing at it by riding the bounce.

South Africa seem very sure it's the former! And it is! De Kock picks up an attempted flick off the legs from Kohli, swooping and shying at the far end!
